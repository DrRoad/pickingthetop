### Introduction

I am a money manager who has closely followed markets for over 20 years and diligently studied as much market history as I can.  Unfortunately, even with what seems to be an infinite amount of market history, we will never have enough.  We will always struggle with uncertainty and risk, and this challenge is what I find so compelling about the market.
