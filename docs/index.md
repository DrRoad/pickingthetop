Picking the Top - A Real-time Story

This is not advice, and in no way should be considered advice. In reality, "picking tops" is a horrible idea that leads to the ruin of anyone reckless or arrogant enough to attempt it.

Introduction
------------

I am a money manager who has closely followed markets for over 20 years and diligently studied as much market history as I can. Unfortunately, even with what seems to be an infinite amount of market history, we will never have enough. We will always struggle with uncertainty and risk, and this challenge is what I find so compelling about markets. What history we have suggests equity markets generally go up, and if we limit our history to the anomaly of the United States, equity market compounding almost seems a guarantee. We are taught that passive buying and holding of stocks offers the best route to building wealth. We even learn that buying tops or breakouts in any market can often be a very successful strategy. Fighting history and trying to make money from picking tops in US stocks seems like a foolish effort with a high probability of disastrous ruin.

I have spent nearly the last five years in cash watching the US stock market persistently climb. I have hit an all-time low as stocks post new highs, and I spend my days distracting myself with data visualization, programming, and photography convinced that in aggregate very little real or compelling opportunity exists. This is no way for a money manager to live, so I have even considered other careers. Fortunately, my study of market history is thorough enough to know that this condition is temporary, and I am emboldened by the most unlikely of opportunities--picking the top in US stocks. The simple belief is that US stock prices have climbed to a level that makes future returns very unlikely. Clearly, I am the dumb one at the market poker table.

Biographies and autobiographies suffer from ex-post rationalization, so I will write this in real-time and my efforts will be actual trades with the little bit of money I have.

While I have the odds and market gods against me, I certainly should not push my luck. Breaking down the US stock market by size suggests that small stocks do best, so it seems the least unlikely bet for a short strategy would be small-cap stocks. However, as you might already have discovered, I am not quite following conventional market wisdom, and I believe the best opportunity for future downside is in this least likely of places. While the chart below from [Research Affiliates, LLC](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/about-us.html) is certainly not the reason I hold this belief, I think it summarizes future prospects for US small stocks very well.
